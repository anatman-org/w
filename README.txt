  this is a Game
  it is a Game of Glass Beads

  the Premise of the Game
  is laid Out in Herman Hesse's Eponymous Work

  Heraclitus Calls It
  "the Game of Children"

  it Sounds like
  the Clifford Jordan Quartet's Eponymous Work

anatman-org is
  the Annotated Manual of the Glass Bead Game

  it is the Index of all Games
  mapped across different Systems of Play

---

at this time
all Ludi Game moves submitted to ANATMAN-ORG
must be either mod-3 mapping to a movement of Pythagorean Squares
or must be mod-4 mapping to quart-imaginary base
perferrably Both

this is because 0ur most efficient hashing algorithms for mod-5 and up
are too expensive to run given the finite computational bandwidth We have Remaining

and because the mod-2 hashing algorithms for remaining Games have either
a conformal mapping to the I Ching sequences [and therefore at least a secondary conformal transformation]
or the games are too numerous to assign a queue position
