this is a Game
it is a Game of Glass Beads

it is a fictional Game
the fictional stakes are the fate of Existence

namely that it is inevitable that a person discover
how to undo existence itself

that the knowledge to do this is already there in pieces
and that there is a fictional race to get Humanity to agree on 0ne thing
