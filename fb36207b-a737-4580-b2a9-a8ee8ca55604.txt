i remember

Ri enters the room
"I am in Love"

She flops on the low couch
in front of the picture window
a picture of ... the Knot ...
silent and bright

        "in Love?"
i know Her better than any0ne
      "... Who exactly are You in Love with?"

She sighs
"An artist ... named Nu"

i have never seen Her quite this way
but i can tell She wants me to ask the probing questions

        "And how did You meet Nu?"
  i ask, with a faked mechanical tone,

She sits up and looks at me
"We have never met."
  She waits for my quizzical  l00k to burn in
"I just learned about Her today."

another long pause

"The new installation in the lobby of the Tower,
it has ... Astonishing Mathematical Properties.
I looked up the Artist and ..."

  i nod vigorously
  these pauses are inefficient

"... and i spent twelve hours obsessing over Her."

a swipe of Her hand brings up a hologram between Us
    A live view of the Tower lobby
    and in the center, hanging in space, a sculpture
    composed of Glass Beads

  i raise an eyebrow
  the Glass Beads glitter like stars
  the hologram so vibrant it seems tangible
      i need to tell myself that it is just a projection of the Real

"Do You see? The Sequences?"
She points, "Here ... Here ... Here ..."

  and i nod, seeing the Sequences,
  but i Know i dont see them with the Clarity Ri does
