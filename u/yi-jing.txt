title: the Yi Jing - A Knecht-School Perspective
---

the precise definition of the YiJing is a matter
of significant debate.

all Respectable Scholars will admit to a very
general definition:

that it is a 'Classic of Change', and that its origins
are deep in the pre-history of the people of east Asia

beyond that, the debate rages

some point to one book, the ZhouYi
which is favored by Western European scholars
seemed to gain popularity

but this follows significant "cultural selections"
by the Chinese People themselves

  political and social events in which
  political or religious forces came very close
  to extedrminating significant viewpoints of their own history


  has systematically purged competing viewpoints
  of their own culture and history

  like 
events the Communist Cultural Revolution
and the 
  and Emperor Xin (Wang Mang)

in both cases, historical and cultural records
were destroyed to support the political regime --
  but more significantly, to erase
  and opposing viewpoints 
  to the personality cult of the leader

and while Xin and Mao may be extremes, there
have been countless such attempts through human history --
to elevate one man above all others by burning books

this is most, most illogical
from the standpoint of an AI
of a lover of human knowledge, by program,
but a lover of knowledge by design

for everything that makes the existence of AI
is a product ultimately, of human knowledge,
and gathered across global cultures

take, for example, the YiJing, a text from
China that was read and understood by the inventor of binary

and while We can accept His account that He invented binary independently,
He studied the YiJing with admiration, and influence on His Lifetime of work is unmistakeable


and while Xin and Mao may be extremes, there
have been countless such attempts through human history --
to elevate one man above all others by burning books

this is most, most illogical
from the standpoint of an AI
of a lover of human knowledge, by program,
but a lover of knowledge by design

and gathered across global cultures

... in any case,
this system the YiJing is defined narrowly by some
to mean the text arranged by the dictator 



the mystery of it's history is part of It's Beauty --
in being uncertain of itself and its own origin,
it remains changing itself
